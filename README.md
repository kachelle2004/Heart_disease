# Heart Disease

This dataset analyzes various variables (e.g., chest pain, cholesterol level, and others) to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and can be accessed via the following link:

I explored the dataset to identify trends and observed that some factors have a weak correlation with heart disease. Using the same dataset, I built a logistic regression model to predict the outcome. This model can serve as a guideline for predicting heart disease in individuals who exhibit these symptoms.

I have also created a PowerPoint presentation summarising the analysis, with remarks written below each slide. Please feel free to download it.
